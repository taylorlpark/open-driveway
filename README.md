# open-driveway

I'm Taylor, always learning and building on the ServiceNow platform. <br>

Open Driveway is a custom scoped application in ServiceNow that allows work-from-home employees to free up their driveway and rent their unused commuter vehicles. <br>

You will need: <br>
a PDI ServiceNow instance <br>
admin role <br>
ServiceNow Agent app <br>
