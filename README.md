# open-driveway

I'm Taylor, always learning and building on the ServiceNow platform. 

Open Driveway is a custom scoped application in ServiceNow that allows work-from-home employees to free up their driveway and rent their unused commuter vehicles. 

You will need: 
a PDI ServiceNow instance
admin role
ServiceNow Agent app
