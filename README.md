# open-driveway

I'm Taylor, always learning and building on the ServiceNow platform. <br>

Open Driveway is a custom scoped application in ServiceNow that allows work-from-home employees to free up their driveway and rent their unused commuter vehicles. <br>

You will need: <br>
PDI/ServiceNow instance <br>
Admin role/rights <br>
The ServiceNow Agent app (iOS or Android)<br>
